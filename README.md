# Hori<span style="color: red">seo</span>n Refactor

## Purpose

My motivation for this project was to improve an existing website by making it more accessible for those with special needs. I made these improvements because I strongly believe that everyone, regardless of their disabilities or deficits, should have access to all the features and digital information of a website. 

## Improvements on Original Code

My changes improve access to those with visual impairments by adding alt attributes to all images, organizing headers in descending order, and creating semantic html which is easier to use with screen readers. These changes also improved SEO and made it easier to access by all viewers. I also removed a significant amount of redundant code to make it easier and clearer for suture deveopers to work on the project.

## Insights

While completing this project I learned different ways that I, as a future web developer, can make it easier for people to view and interact with sites. It surprised me how small and quick these changes were from a developer perspective, but that they dramatically improved the end-user experience.
